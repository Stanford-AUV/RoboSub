# ROS2 Robot Project Structure

## `src`  
**Contains all the core packages and functionalities for the robot's operation, structured into distinct modules:**

- **`control`**  
  Manages the robot's actuation and movement, including PID control, trajectory execution, and motor commands.

- **`hardware`**  
  Interfaces with the robot's physical components such as sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers.

- **`perception`**  
  Processes sensory data (e.g., vision, LIDAR) for tasks like object detection, localization, and mapping.

- **`planning`**  
  Handles motion planning, path optimization, and high-level decision-making algorithms.

- **`simulation`**  
  Provides a virtual testing environment for the robot, integrating with tools like Gazebo for realistic simulations.

---

## Additional Directories

- **`launch`**  
  Contains ROS2 launch files to easily set up and execute various configurations and modules.

- **`msgs`**  
  Defines custom ROS2 message types used for communication between nodes.

# Anatomy of a ROS2 Package

## Structure of `pkg_name`

### `pkg_name/pkg_name`  
The main directory containing the following subdirectories and scripts:

- **`nodes`**  
  Contains the Python or C++ executable nodes for the package.

- **`utils`**  
  Includes helper scripts, libraries, or utility functions to support the package.

### `pkg_name/launch`  
Stores launch files to initialize and configure nodes, parameters, and system behavior.

### `pkg_name/resource`  
Holds package-specific resources such as configuration files, parameters, or additional assets.

### `pkg_name/test`  
Contains test cases and testing scripts to validate the functionality of the package.

## Files in `pkg_name`

- **`package.xml`**  
  Metadata file defining the package's dependencies, build information, and description.

- **`setup.cfg`**  
  Configuration file specifying metadata and options for Python packaging.

- **`setup.py`**  
  Build script to install the package and its dependencies. <span style="color:#4488FF">When adding nodes, make sure to include them in the `entry_points` argument of `setup()`.</span>

# Notes

This structure is a standard layout for ROS2 packages, designed to ensure modularity, reusability, and clarity across projects.
